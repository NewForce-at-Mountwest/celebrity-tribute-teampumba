You'll want to create an HTML document for each page of your website. In your navbar, put the name of each HTML file as the `href` value of each `a` tag. For example: 
```html
<nav>
    <a href="index.html">Executive Summary</a>
    <a href="career.html">Career</a>
    <a href="personal.html">Personal</a>
    <a href="news.html">News</a>
